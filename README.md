Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. It involves designing, building, and maintaining websites using various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Web developers typically work on both the front-end and back-end aspects of a website, handling tasks such as writing code, designing user interfaces, integrating databases, implementing functionality, and ensuring the website's responsiveness and performance. Web development encompasses a wide range of skills and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side programming languages (such as Python, Ruby, or PHP), databases, and web frameworks (like React, Angular, or Django).

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a coding language used to describe the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). CSS allows web developers to control the appearance and layout of web pages, including elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

With CSS, you can define styles for individual HTML elements or apply styles to groups of elements. It works by selecting HTML elements using selectors and applying styling rules to them. CSS separates the design and layout of a webpage from its content, allowing developers to make global changes to the appearance of a website by modifying a single CSS file.

CSS operates on a cascade principle, where multiple styles can be applied to an element, and conflicts are resolved based on specificity and inheritance rules. This cascading behavior allows developers to define styles at different levels, including inline styles within HTML tags, internal styles within the <style> tag in the HTML document, and external stylesheets linked to the HTML file.

CSS has evolved over time and now includes advanced features such as animations, transformations, and responsive design techniques. It plays a crucial role in modern web development, enabling developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
